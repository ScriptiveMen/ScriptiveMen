## Hey there! 👋

I'm [Satya](https://satyakumarram.in), a Full Stack Web Developer based in India.

I build web applications with a focus on clean code and reliable structure.

I enjoy working on ideas and turning them into useful digital products.

My main tech stack is MERN with a growing focus on GenAI. My favorite tools are Figma, Postman, and Docker.

I've built over 40 public repos, but privately.. it's probably more than 45 at this point.

You can explore some of my work in the pinned repositories below.
